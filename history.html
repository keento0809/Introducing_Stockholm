        The name Stockholm first appears in historical records in letters
        written by Birger Jarl and King Valdemar dated 1252. However, the two
        letters give no information about the appearance of the city and events
        during the following decades remain diffuse. While the absence of a
        perpendicular city plan in medieval Stockholm seems to indicate a
        spontaneous growth, it is known German merchants invited by Birger jarl
        played an important role in the foundation of the city. Under any
        circumstance, during the end of the 13th century, Stockholm quickly grew
        to become not only the largest city in Sweden, but also the de facto
        Swedish political centre and royal residence. Thus, from its foundation,
        Stockholm has been the largest and most important Swedish city,
        inseparable from and dependent on the Swedish government. However, as
        late as the 16th century, reigns of Kings Eric XIV and John III, whose
        Swedish government often travelled with them elsewhere (see below), the
        city was still not what could be called a national capital in modern
        terms.
        <br /><br />
        Because Stockholm had a city wall, it was exempted from the tax paid by
        other Swedish cities. During the reign of Gustav Vasa the city's
        fortifications were reinforced and in the Stockholm Archipelago, Vaxholm
        was created to guard the inlet from the Baltic. While the medieval
        structure of Stockholm remained mostly unaltered during the 16th
        century, the city's social and economic importance grew to the extent
        that no king could permit the city to determine its own faith – the most
        important export item being bar iron and the most important destination
        Lübeck. During the reign of Vasa's sons, trade led many Swedes to settle
        in the city, but the trade and the capital needed to control it was
        largely in the hands of the king and German merchants from Lübeck and
        Danzig. Throughout the era, Sweden could hardly claim the level of
        government and bureaucracy requisite to a capital in the modern sense,
        but Stockholm was the kingdom's strongest bastion and the king's main
        residence. As Eric XIV's pretensions were on par with those of
        Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself the largest
        court his finances could possibly support, and the royal castle was thus
        the biggest employer in the city.
