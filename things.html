                <p>    
                    Around 1.5 million visitors every year enjoy the exhibitions in the museum, which describe the warship Vasa's history and life at the time; how, after 333 years at the bottom of Stockholm bay, the ship was rediscovered and salvaged; and the research which is now underway to preserve Vasa. The Vasa Museum lies in the royal parkland, Djurgården, in Stockholm.
                    The Vasa Museum is a part of the Swedish National Maritime and Transport Museums, together with the Maritime Museum and Vrak - Museum of Wrecks in Stockholm, the Naval Museum in Karlskrona and the Railway Museum in Gävle.
