          The name Stockholm first appears in historical records in letters
          written by Birger Jarl and King Valdemar dated 1252. However, the two
          letters give no information about the appearance of the city and
          events during the following decades remain diffuse. While the absence
          of a perpendicular city plan in medieval Stockholm seems to indicate a
          spontaneous growth, it is known German merchants invited by Birger
          jarl played an important role in the foundation of the city. Under any
          circumstance, during the end of the 13th century, Stockholm quickly
          grew to become not only the largest city in Sweden, but also the de
          facto Swedish political centre and royal residence. Thus, from its
          foundation, Stockholm has been the largest and most important Swedish
          city, inseparable from and dependent on the Swedish government.
          However, as late as the 16th century, reigns of Kings Eric XIV and
          John III, whose Swedish government often travelled with them elsewhere
          (see below), the city was still not what could be called a national
          capital in modern terms.
          <br /><br />
          Because Stockholm had a city wall, it was exempted from the tax paid
          by other Swedish cities. During the reign of Gustav Vasa the city's
          fortifications were reinforced and in the Stockholm Archipelago,
          Vaxholm was created to guard the inlet from the Baltic. While the
          medieval structure of Stockholm remained mostly unaltered during the
          16th century, the city's social and economic importance grew to the
          extent that no king could permit the city to determine its own faith –
          the most important export item being bar iron and the most important
          destination Lübeck. During the reign of Vasa's sons, trade led many
          Swedes to settle in the city, but the trade and the capital needed to
          control it was largely in the hands of the king and German merchants
          from Lübeck and Danzig. Throughout the era, Sweden could hardly claim
          the level of government and bureaucracy requisite to a capital in the
          modern sense, but Stockholm was the kingdom's strongest bastion and
          the king's main residence. As Eric XIV's pretensions were on par with
          those of Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself the
          largest court his finances could possibly support, and the royal
          castle was thus the biggest employer in the city.

              Around 1.5 million visitors every year enjoy the exhibitions in
              the museum, which describe the warship Vasa's history and life at
              the time; how, after 333 years at the bottom of Stockholm bay, the
              ship was rediscovered and salvaged; and the research which is now
              underway to preserve Vasa. The Vasa Museum lies in the royal
              parkland, Djurgården, in Stockholm. The Vasa Museum is a part of
              the Swedish National Maritime and Transport Museums, together with
              the Maritime Museum and Vrak - Museum of Wrecks in Stockholm, the
              Naval Museum in Karlskrona and the Railway Museum in Gävle.
