          The name Stockholm first appears in historical records in letters
          written by Birger Jarl and King Valdemar dated 1252. However, the two
          letters give no information about the appearance of the city and
          events during the following decades remain diffuse. While the absence
          of a perpendicular city plan in medieval Stockholm seems to indicate a
          spontaneous growth, it is known German merchants invited by Birger
          jarl played an important role in the foundation of the city. Under any
          circumstance, during the end of the 13th century, Stockholm quickly
          grew to become not only the largest city in Sweden, but also the de
          facto Swedish political centre and royal residence. Thus, from its
          foundation, Stockholm has been the largest and most important Swedish
          city, inseparable from and dependent on the Swedish government.
          However, as late as the 16th century, reigns of Kings Eric XIV and
          John III, whose Swedish government often travelled with them elsewhere
          (see below), the city was still not what could be called a national
          capital in modern terms.

              the time; how, after 333 years at the bottom of Stockholm bay, the

            <p>
              This old town is the place where Stockholm took birth in the early
              13th century. Located at the little island of Stadsholmen, the
              ancient and narrow cobbled streets gives a medieval vibe which is
              adorned with many souvenir shops, bars and restaurants. And before
              leaving make sure to not miss out the Mårten Trotzigs Gränd, which
              is the narrowest street of Stockholm. The Gamla Stan is one of
              places to visit in Stockholm for free and explore the historical
              treasures of the town.
